            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>
                In my role as a Software Engineer at Kikuya Bisyodo Inc., I
                played a pivotal role in spearheading the transformative
                Fomalhaut project, a landmark initiative for our organization.
              </li>
              <li>
                I actively addressed the project's technical requirements and
                design preferences as outlined by our team, with a strong focus
                on backend development. My expertise lies in leveraging Spring
                Boot and crafting SQL queries to power our systems.
              </li>
              <li>
                Furthermore, I led the end-to-end design of our frontend and
                desktop app ecosystem, while managing the deployment of several
                crucial servers. These efforts resulted in user-friendly
                interfaces, vastly improving the daily workflows of our
                warehouse staff, from order processing to shipping.
              </li>
              <li>
                To enhance project efficiency, I implemented a robust CI/CD
                pipeline, automating key processes. In my capacity as the
                project leader, I fostered a culture of collaboration and
                inclusivity, encouraging diverse perspectives.
              </li>
              <li>
                During the initial project phases, when React expertise was
                scarce, I proactively provided mentorship and guidance to our
                development team. Additionally, I engineered reusable modules,
                streamlining development for the entire team.
              </li>
              <li>
                I successfully integrated advanced animations into our frontend
                using CSS and Framer Motion within the React framework. My
                design work was carried out in Figma, and I also took the
                initiative to educate and upskill team members in the effective
                utilization of Figma.
              </li>

                My tenure at Fomalhaut has allowed me to contribute to
                innovative warehouse management systems, and I am honored to

                  This blog is a haven for artists to share their comics,
                  showcasing a blend of a compelling blog and a Progressive Web
                  App (PWA). This project highlights my proficiency in creating
                  engaging online platforms that offer both rich features and
                  optimal performance.
